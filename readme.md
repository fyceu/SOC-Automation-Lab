# SOC Automation Lab
This project will focus on automating and managing security operations workflows. The lab's objective is to simulate real-world SOC activities, from monitoring and alerting to incident response automation, providing hands-on experience with essential tools used in the security operations field. Additionally, this project will showcase the provisioning of servers and the  implementation of different security tools and services, typically handled by a Security Engineer. The goal is to build, automate, and maintain security operation workflows that are efficient, scalable, and reproducible. 
## Lab Topology

### Topology Breakdown
- Windows Workstation: 
- Ubuntu Server: Serves as the backbone of the security services. Wazuh, Shuffle, and TheHive will be hosted on this server. The usage of Docker to containerize each service can be used to expand availability and scalability. 
- Wazuh: Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) and Extended Detection adn Response (XDR) platform that will provide log collection, intrusion detection, and compliance monitoring for the lab. 
- Shuffle: Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) platform that automates incident response workflows. Integrating with Wazuh will allow us to initialize and trigger playbooks response to Wazuh alerts. 
- TheHive: Centralized platform for case management and incident response -- Used to track, manage, and resolve cases that are generated by alerts.
